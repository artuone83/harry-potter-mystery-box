Ths folder is further broken down into under folders subfolders. These subfolders are useful since they help keep components organized into different sections.

You can customize and breakdown this components folder however you see fit based on your project needs, but ideally this folder shouldn't get too large as many of more complex components will be stored in the `features` folder.

Example:

`ui` folder which contains all our UI components like buttons, modals, cards, etc.

`form` folder for form specific controls like checkboxes, inputs, date pickers, etc.
